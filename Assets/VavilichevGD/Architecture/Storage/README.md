# Storage system for Unity

• Async operation supported (with callbacks)<br>
• Coroutine operation supported (with callbacks also)<br>
• Only local (file) storage realized now<br>
• The system is flexible and support expanding with a cloud storage really easy<br>
• Mobile friendly<br>
<br>

### v. 2.12.
- More flexible aproach to save the  game data with key-value pair. Looks like Player Prefs, but it isn't the same. New version supports all serializable objects and stored in one place (file or cloud, cloud doesn't supported yet).
